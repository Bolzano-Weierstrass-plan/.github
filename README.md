# This is the Bolzano-Weierstrass plan

## Introduction
We are three Augustana University college students trying to change our lives one rule at a time. In a world full of distractions, we are trying to lead a life with minimal distractions. This organization is the result of that resolution.
The name is inspired by the Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem, which states that things getting closer to each other eventually converges. In light of the theorem, we are constantly trying to acheive our goals bit by bit, since we are not able to achieve it at the first few times.
For this purpose, each of us have three rules that we have to follow. Failure to follow any of the rules will result in an agreed upon penalty among us.

## Rules

## Penalities
1. For each violation of the rules, walk around the Augie campus.
If the penalty was not enforced for any reason - e.g. being too busy - then walk around +1 time each day it was failed to be enforced.
2. [For Deepak and Soobin] At the same time as Penalty #1, for each violation, $10 must be spent to take tlu22 out for dinner.
In return, tlu22 must give a referral to Deepak and Soobin, if tlu22 becomes a top executive in any company in the future.

### tlu22's rules
1. 3 hours of math a day. No irralevent web browsing and phone use during math time.
2. no phone in bed, no gaming/video watching/web browsing before 2pm or after 11pm.
3. same as Soobin's second rule.

### Deepak's Rules
1. No usage of mobile phone during focus times unless it is an emergency. Focus times include *work time*, *study time*, or any other dedicated times.
2. Gym for atleast three hours every week, and calorie intake of 2500 - 3000 calories per day based on the heaviest meal calorie count of the day.
3. Same as Soobin's third rule

### Soobin's Rules
1. Same as Deepak's Rule #1.
In addition, whenever I start a focus time, choose how much time I want and set a timer on my phone.
Never open the phone, unless I get a notification -- e.g. someone calls me or texts me.
In the case of someone contacting me, for example if someone calls me, I should only use the phone for the contact, and never leave the app.
2. Every day, meditate at least 10 minutes.
3. Every day, create a schedule for the day with specific times and brief description of what to do for each time.
However, given that a lot of unknown factors affect our scheduling, we define success flexibly.
If I did each of the schedule items at least for 10 minutes, then it's counted as a success.
It's counted as a failiure, only if one or more items of the schedule have not been done at all.
The order of the schedule can be changed, as long as all of the items in the schedule have been done.
