# This is the Bolzano-Weierstrass plan

> The name Bolzano-Weierstrass plan is inspired by the Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem, which states that things getting closer to each other eventually converges.

We are three college students trying to change our lives one rule at a time.
A lot of things we do in our daily life, we believe, are not exactly what we'd like ourselves to do.
Instead, the vast majority of our habits have been formed either unconsciously or in a way that we do not like at all.
We wanted to change that.
In a world full of distractions, we wanted to lead our own lives.

We've had many attempts like this before, and after countless failures, we realized it's better to make easier goals rather than perfect-sounding goals.
Thus, our main philosophy here is to just remember three things to live by every day -- hence the ***rules*** listed below.
A wise man once said, "you need 27 days to form a habit."
Here's our plan -- we try our best to make these our habits.
Do not make them too hard. Otherwise, we might fail yet again.
Make the right thing the easy thing to do.
Also, form a group and create self-enforced consequences for failing to follow the rules.
Hold each other accountable.

## Overview
- Everyday, each of us must create a status report and commit it to each of our `<name>-record` repository.
- Each of us gets to choose our own rules.
- Try to make the penalties small enough that we never feel like giving up and big enough to feel the consequences whenever we fail to follow our own rules.
- Any of the rules can be modified, if and only if all of the members explicitly give consent.

## Penalities
- `Deepak` `Soobin`: For each violation of the rules, walk around the entire Augie campus on the day of the violation.
- `tlu22`: For each violation of the rules, run around the entire Augie campus on the day of the violation.
- `@all`: If the penalty was not enforced for any reason - e.g. being too busy - then +1 each day.
- `Deepak` `Soobin`: For each violation of the rules, reserve $10 to take tlu22 out for fun time (food, etc).
In return, tlu22 must give a referral to Deepak and Soobin, if tlu22 becomes a top executive in a company, and if Deepak and Soobin are in the need of a company referral.

## tlu22's Rules
1. 3 hours of math a day. No irralevent web browsing and phone use during math time.
2. no phone in bed, no gaming/video watching/web browsing before 2pm or after 11pm.
3. same as Soobin's second rule.

## Deepak's Rules
1. No usage of mobile phone during focus times unless it is an emergency. Focus times include *work time*, *study time*, or any other dedicated times.
2. Gym for atleast three hours every week, and calorie intake of 2500 - 3000 calories per day based on the heaviest meal calorie count of the day.
3. Same as Soobin's third rule

## Soobin's Rules
1. Same as Deepak's Rule #1.
In addition, whenever I start a focus time, choose how much time I want and set a timer on my phone.
Never open the phone, unless I get a notification -- e.g. someone calls me or texts me.
In the case of someone contacting me, for example if someone calls me, I should only use the phone for the contact, and never leave the app.
2. Every day, meditate at least 10 minutes.
3. Every day, create a schedule for the day with specific times and brief description of what to do for each time.
However, given that a lot of unknown factors affect our scheduling, we define success flexibly.
If I did each of the schedule items at least for 10 minutes, then it's counted as a success.
It's counted as a failiure, only if one or more items of the schedule have not been done at all.
The order of the schedule can be changed, as long as all of the items in the schedule have been done.
