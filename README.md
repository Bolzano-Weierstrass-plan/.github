# This is the Bolzano-Weierstrass plan

# Introduction
We are three Augustana University college students trying to change our lives one rule at a time. In a world full of distractions, we are trying to lead a life with minimal distractions. This organization is the result of that resolution.   
The name is inspired by the Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem, which states that things getting closer to each other eventually converges. In light of the theorem, we are constantly trying to acheive our goals bit by bit, since we are not able to achieve it at the first few times. 
For this purpose, each of us have three rules that we have to follow. Failure to follow any of the rules will result in an agreed upon penalty among us. 

# Rules

3. Same as Soobin's third rule
