# This is the Bolzano-Weierstrass plan

> The name Bolzano-Weierstrass plan is inspired by the Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem, which states that things getting closer to each other eventually converges.

A lot of things we do in our own life everyday, we do them not because we want to, but because we have these habits that have been formed witout us knowing at all.
Most often the case, a lot of these are not the way we want our lives to be, and yet, we spend hundreds or thousands of hours doing these things we're not even consciously aware of.
We wanted to change that.
In a world full of distractions, we wanted to ***lead*** our own life.

We've had many attempts like this before, and after countless failures, we realized it's crucial to make achievable goals and also have some kind of mechanism where we keep each other accountable.
Thus, our main philosophy here is for each of us to make three rules for ourselves and to do so in a way that we continuously encourage each other -- hence the ***Rules*** listed below.

A wise man once said, "you need 21 days to form a habit."
So, here's our plan.
We try our best to make these rules our habits.
Do not make them too hard.
Otherwise, we might fail yet again.
Make the right thing the easy thing to do.
Form a group, ***and call it the Bolzano-Weierstrass plan***, and create self-enforced consequences for failing to follow the rules.
Hold each other accountable.
Help each other live the life they want to live.

<br>

***Overview***<br>
- Each of us gets to choose our own rules.
Make them as specific, objective, and measurable as possible.
We need to know exactly when we're following our own rules, and when we are not.
Otherwise, our future-self might be able to move the boundaries however our future-self wants, which is not what we want here.
- Everyday or every month (or however you want), each of us should write a status report and commit it to each of our `<name>-record` repository. This should be as simple as possible so that the process feels as easy as it can be.
- Try to make the penalties small enough that we never feel like giving up and big enough that we strongly feel the consequences whenever we fail to follow our own rules.

<br>

***Penalities***<br>
- `Deepak` `Soobin`: For each violation of the rules, {walk around the entire Augie campus by the day after the violation}, {go to the gym}, {swim}, or {do 50 (or 20 until my body gets strong enough) pushups, 50 (or 20) squats, 50 (or 20) seconds of wall sit, and 50 (or 20) seconds of plank}.
- `tlu22`: For each violation of the rules, run around the entire Augie campus by the day after the violation.
- `Julian`: Failure to comply with the one hour rule results with punisment of completing one canvas assignment, if no assignment available 10 minute reading is required.

## Rules

**tlu22's Rules [[Daily Record](https://github.com/Bolzano-Weierstrass-plan/tlu22-record)]**
1. Study time: 9am to 4pm everyday, 6pm to 9pm on TR, 6pm to 7:30 pm on MW. No phone use after 11pm or in studytime unless necessary(submit homework, write email, two-factor authorization)
2. For each section of linear algebra, complete in $[\frac{num Exercise}{15}]$ days. 
3. same as Soobin's second rule.

**Deepak's Rules [[Daily Record](https://github.com/Bolzano-Weierstrass-plan/deepak-record)]**
1. No usage of mobile phone during focus times unless it is an emergency. Focus times include **work time**, **study time**, or any other dedicated times.
2. Gym for at least three hours every week, and calorie intake of 2500 - 3000 calories per day based on the heaviest meal calorie count of the day.
3. The problem of scheduling our day is that there are too many unexpected factors that affect our schedule all the time.
Thus, we're doing what we call dynamic scheduling.
As opposed to static scheduling in which we have to follow every schedule minute by minute, dynamic shceduling takes all of those unexpected variables into account.
With dynamic scheduling, we're allowed to change the order in which we do those and at which time we do it, even how much time we do it.
As long as we do it for at least some amount of time, which in my case is defined as 10 minutes, then it's counted as a success.
For example, use the mind palace technique to memorize (internalize) at least one thing a day.

**Soobin's Rules [[Daily Record](https://github.com/Bolzano-Weierstrass-plan/soobin-record)]**
1. Spend less than 3 hours on YouTube, Reddit, and Chrome (unless watching something with intent and without being a mindless habit) on my phone. Android Phones come with the `Digital Wellbeing (Google)` app by default. According to this, I've been spending at least six hours everyday on these three apps. Those are cool, and not super bad, but it's not exactly how I want my life to be spent.
2. Sit down without any kind of distractions, including but not limited to phones and laptops, for at least 10 minutes a day.
It must be in the sitting-down position.
Never lay down during the meditation because I tend to fall asleep if I do that. Also, update the mind palace to remember tasks (daily todo list or long-term tasks), for at least 10 minutes a day.
3. Practice eye contact (it's rude not to...) for at least two minutes a day.

> 1. At the end of each work day, write down the six most important things you need to accomplish tomorrow. Do not write down more than six tasks.
> 2. Prioritize those six items in order of their true importance.
> 3. When you arrive tomorrow, concentrate only on the first task. Work until the first task is finished before moving on to the second task.
> 4. Approach the rest of your list in the same fashion. At the end of the day, move any unfinished items to a new list of six tasks for the following day.
> 5. Repeat this process every working day.<br>

**Julian's Rules [[Daily record](https://github.com/Bolzano-Weierstrass-plan/Julian-Record)]**
1. Reach an average of 7 hours study in the weekday (this is outside of school hw and studying).
